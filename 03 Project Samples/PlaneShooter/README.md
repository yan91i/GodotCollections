# Plane Shooter - Godot 4.X

This repository contains a **2D Space Shooter Game** developed in **Godot 4**, inspired by the original tutorials created by the talented YouTuber **Sunny GameDev**. The tutorials were originally designed for Unity, but I have ported the same game to Godot, showcasing how it can be recreated in a different engine.

## 🎥 Tutorial Playlist (Unity Version)
The original Unity tutorials by Sunny GameDev can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHambu-eVQs&list=PLCqWuVe6WFLK6-AMsuEmyvGIPwwXXhyhJ). These tutorials are an excellent resource for learning how to create a 2D space shooter game.

## 🌟 Project Features
- Classic **2D space shooter mechanics**:
  - Player-controlled spaceship with movement and shooting.
  - Waves of enemy ships with varying patterns.
  - Scoring system and game over logic.
- Ported from Unity to Godot, leveraging the unique features of the **Godot 4 engine**.
- A clean and modular project structure, ideal for learning or extending further.
- Plans for a **Godot tutorial series** to help others recreate this game in Godot.

## 📺 Upcoming Godot Tutorial Series
I am planning to create a similar YouTube tutorial series for **Godot 4**, making it easier for developers familiar with Godot to learn and build this game. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Godot 4**: The game engine used for development.
- **GDScript**: Primary scripting language for implementing game logic.
