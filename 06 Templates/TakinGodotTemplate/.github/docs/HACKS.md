**Notes**
- Renaming root folder
	- localization files will need to be re-imported (Project > Project Settings > Localization)
	- font files will lose fallbacks and will need to be re-imported after setting fallbacks again
	- constant `const ROOT: String` will need to be updated to new value (`path_consts.gd`)
	- scene manager plugin will need to be re-saved (in Scene Manager tab, click Refresh then Save)
