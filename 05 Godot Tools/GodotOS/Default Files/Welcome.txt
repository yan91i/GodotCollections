Welcome to GodotOS!

GodotOS is a fake operating system where
you can play games, manage folders,
view images, and edit text files!

Here are some shortcuts to get you started:
*    Fullscreen: Alt + Enter or F11
*    Open (real) File Manager: Ctrl + Shift + F
*    Close ALL Windows: Ctrl + Shift + Delete

If you need more info, read the GodotOS Handbook!
It's in this very same folder.
