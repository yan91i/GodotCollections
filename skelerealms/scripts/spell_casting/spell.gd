class_name Spell
extends Resource
## This the base class for any spell that NPCs can cast.
## This essentially a blank slate, and as this is a GDScript file, a spell can do literally anything, sky is the limit.
## However, with great control comes great responsibility, my uncle once told me. This means you need to deal with basic stuff, like willpower drain, yourself.
## Despite that, it includes a number of helper methods to do the simple stuff. See [method _find_spell_targets_in_range].


## Spell's ID for translation.
@export var spell_name:String
## Custom assets for this spell; particles, floating hand models, whatever.
## You can pack it all in here so you don't have to use load(), but you can still do that if you want to.
@export var spell_assets:Dictionary
## An array of spell effects we can apply to something we hit.
@export var spell_effects:Array[StringName]
## Whether being hit by this spell is to be considered an attack.
@export var aggressive:bool = false
## The spell caster.
var _caster:SpellHand


## When the spell is first cast.
func on_spell_cast():
	pass


## Called every frame as the spell is being held by the player; eg. as the button is being held to blast flames.
## You can use the delta to drain willpower, or whatever.
func on_spell_held(delta):
	pass


## When the spell is released; eg. when the button is released.
## This doesn't just have to cancel the spell, though; perhaps the player needs to hold a spell to choose a target or charge a kamehameha, and then release to cast.
func on_spell_released():
	pass


## Called when the spell needs to be reset to cast again, and also when it is loaded for the first time; so this is also like a _ready() function.
## Only reset your own variables; the variables defined in this parent class will not be re-initialized.
func reset():
	pass


func process(delta:float) -> void:
	pass


func physics_process(delta:float) -> void:
	pass


## Find all nodes in a range of a point, with the results in a dictionary matching a physics query (like raycasting). 
## You can use this for an AOE attack.
## Using ignore_self assumes that the caster's origin defines the root of the actor casting it.
## Only returns 32 results max.

## Only works if target is of type [SpellTargetComponent] or [SpellTargetObject].

## Casts a ray, and returns anything it hits, with the results in a dictionary matching a physics query (like raycasting). The dictionary is empty if it hits nothing.
## Using ignore_self assumes that the caster's origin defines the root of the actor casting it.
